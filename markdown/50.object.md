##### A JavaScript property is a member of an object that associates a key with a value. A JavaScript object is a data structure that stores a collection of properties.

##### A property consists of the following parts:

##### A name (also called a key), which is either a string or a symbol.
##### A value, which can be any JavaScript value. A property that has a function as its value may also be called a method.

##### Some attributes, which specify how the property can be read and written. A property may have the configurable, enumerable, and writable attributes.
