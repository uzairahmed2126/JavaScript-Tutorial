# Variable in (var) JavaScript
##  There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers). Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.
```javascript
// A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location.
var a =
  'This is a (var) variable and we can declare multi times this same variable and we can reassign this variable.'
```
