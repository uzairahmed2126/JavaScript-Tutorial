# Ternary Operator
##### The conditional (ternary) operator is the  operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark ( ? ), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon ( : ), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy.

``` javascript
// Syntax
Condition ? statement true : false;
// Example
let  age = 19;
age <=20 ? console.log(true):console.log(false);
```
