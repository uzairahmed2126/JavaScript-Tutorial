# Sort and Reverse method of Array
#### The sort() method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the reference to the same array, now sorted. 

#### The reverse() of an array means to change the order of the given array's elements. This technique reverses the last element of the array into the first one, and the first element becomes the last. However, the process continues until all characters or elements of the array are completely reversed.
