# Do While Loop
### We have to use do while loop when we need to execute a group of statements at least once. Only difference between while and do while loop is that while loop will execute statements only when given condition is true whereas do while will execute statements at least once without checking the condition.

##### Syntax

```javascript
// Initialization
let a=1;
do{
// statement
console.log("Assalamu Alaikum");
// Increment & Decrement
a++;
// Condition
}while(a<=10)
```
