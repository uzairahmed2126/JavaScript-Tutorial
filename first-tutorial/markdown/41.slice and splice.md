# Slice and Splice
* slice() The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to end ( end not included) where start and end represent the index of items in that array. The original array will not be modified.
  
* The splice() method is a built-in method for JavaScript Array objects. It lets you change the content of your array by removing or replacing existing elements with new ones. This method modifies the original array and returns the removed elements as a new array
