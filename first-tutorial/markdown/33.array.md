# Array
#### Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. This is compared to a variable that can store only one value. Each item in an array has a number attached to it, called a numeric index, that allows you to access it. In JavaScript, arrays start at index zero and can be manipulated with various methods.

```javascript
// Syntax
let a = [10,20,30];
```
