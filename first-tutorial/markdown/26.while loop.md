# While Loop
#### A "While" Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code an unknown number of times, until a condition is met. For example, if we want to ask a user for a number between 1 and 10, we don't know how many times the user may enter a larger number, so we keep asking "while the number is not between 1 and 10".

```javascript
// Initialization
let a=1;
// condition
while(a<=10){
// statement
    document.write(a);
// increment and decrement
a++;}
```
